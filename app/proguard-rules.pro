# If your project uses WebView with JS, uncomment the following
# and specify the fully qualified class name to the JavaScript interface
# class:

# Uncomment this to preserve the line number information for
# debugging stack traces.

# If you keep the line number information, uncomment this to

#-renamesourcefileattribute SourceFile
# Preserve the entry class and all its members from being obfuscated

# The key fragments (kf, ivF) and derived methods (keyBytes, ivBytes)
# are deliberately NOT kept - R8 renames and inlines them so the
# encryption key material is not trivially extractable from DEX.
